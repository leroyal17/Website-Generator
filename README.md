# Website-Generator
My attempt at trying to create a script that will dynamically pull content from the web, based on keywords, and place them into html templates, for rapid website development. Of course, once imported, the text in the html output must be modified to the user's liking,  but it saves time with pulling information. This tool would definitely come in handy for phishing campaigns and normal web development. 

Note: This tool is not completed....
